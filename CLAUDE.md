# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

ProjetoLP.API is a **clinic management REST API** built with ASP.NET Core 10 / .NET 10 and SQLite. It handles patient scheduling, medical records, payments, and WhatsApp notifications for a physiotherapy clinic.

## Commands

```bash
# Restore dependencies
dotnet restore

# Build
dotnet build

# Run (dev server on http://localhost:5045, Swagger at /swagger)
dotnet run --launch-profile http

# EF Core migrations
dotnet ef migrations add <MigrationName>
dotnet ef database update
```

No test project exists — the API is tested via HTTP against the running server or Swagger UI.

## Architecture

### Stack
- **ASP.NET Core 10** with attribute-based routing controllers
- **Entity Framework Core 10 + SQLite** — database file `projetolp.db` is committed to the repo for local dev
- **JWT Bearer** stored in HttpOnly cookies (8-hour expiry)
- **BCrypt.Net-Next** for password hashing

### Startup Flow (`Program.cs`)
Program.cs does three things in order:
1. Registers all services (DI, EF, Auth, CORS, Swagger, typed HTTP client for WhatsApp)
2. Builds the middleware pipeline (CORS → StaticFiles → Auth/Authz → HTTPS → Controllers)
3. Seeds initial data on first run (2 users, 5 plans, sample patients/appointments/payments)

### Background Services (`/Services`)
Three `IHostedService` implementations run hourly:
- `AppointmentStatusUpdater` — auto-cancels past Scheduled appointments
- `AppointmentReminderJob` — sends WhatsApp reminders 23–25h before appointments; uses `ReminderSent` flag to prevent duplicate sends
- `PaymentReminderJob` — sends WhatsApp reminders 23–25h before payment due dates; uses `PaymentReminderSent` flag

### WhatsApp Integration
`WhatsAppService` is a typed `HttpClient` that POSTs to the Evolution API:
- Endpoint: `POST /message/sendText/{instance}`
- Payload: `{ "number": "55XXXXXXXXXX", "textMessage": { "text": "..." } }`
- Normalizes Brazilian phone numbers to always include country code `55`
- All sends are logged to `WhatsAppLog` table for auditing

### Data Model

| Entity | Key Fields | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| `User` | Email, CPF, Role (Admin/Fisio) | Password stored as BCrypt hash, never returned in responses |
| `Patient` | Phone, IsActive | IsActive=false blocks scheduling; soft-delete pattern |
| `Appointment` | Status (Scheduled/Completed/Cancelled), ReminderSent | Past scheduled → auto-cancelled hourly |
| `Payment` | Status (Pending/Paid/Cancelled), ReferenceMonth (YYYY-MM), PlanId | Amount auto-populated from linked Plan |
| `Plans` | TipoPlano (Mensal/Avulso), TipoSessao, Valor, IsActive | |
| `MedicalRecord` | PDF contract + image exams stored in `wwwroot/` with GUID names | |
| `Expense` | ReferenceMonth (YYYY-MM) | Used for monthly P&L balance |
| `WhatsAppLog` | Phone, Message, Status, PatientId (nullable) | Audit trail |

### Authorization
- `[AllowAnonymous]`: `POST /api/auth/login` only
- `[Authorize]`: all other endpoints require valid JWT cookie
- `[Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]`: Payments write, Financial, Users management, Plans creation

### Response Patterns
- All list endpoints return `PagedResult<T>` with `{ data, page, pageSize, totalCount, totalPages }`
- Enums serialize as strings (`"Scheduled"` not `0`) via `JsonStringEnumConverter`
- File uploads: PDF max 10MB, images (JPG/PNG) max 5MB — stored in `wwwroot/`

### Business Rules (validated in controllers)
- Cannot schedule appointments for inactive patients
- Cannot delete patients with active appointments or payments
- Cannot delete plans that have associated payments
- Cannot delete the last Admin user
- Cannot delete Paid payments

## Configuration

`appsettings.json` contains JWT secret and Evolution API key in plaintext (development only). In production these must be moved to environment variables or user secrets.

```json
{
  "Jwt": { "Key": "...", "Issuer": "ProjetoLP.API", "Audience": "ProjetoLP.Client" },
  "EvolutionApi": { "BaseUrl": "http://localhost:8080", "ApiKey": "...", "Instance": "clinica" },
  "ConnectionStrings": { "DefaultConnection": "Data Source=projetolp.db" }
}
```

CORS is hardcoded to `http://localhost:3000` (the frontend dev server).
